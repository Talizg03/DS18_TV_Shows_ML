Research Question: "How could genres, languages, and other factors predict the popularity of TV shows?"
The goal of this project was to predict TV show popularity using various features such as genres, languages, vote counts, and other relevant characteristics. By analyzing the TMDB TV Shows Dataset, which contained data for 150,000 TV shows, I aimed to explore the relationships between these factors and a show's popularity. Using machine learning models, the objective was to develop a system that could predict trends in TV show popularity, providing valuable insights for content creators, distributors, and streaming platforms.

Dataset Overview:
The TMDB TV Shows Dataset 2024 was a comprehensive collection of TV show data sourced from the TMDB (The Movie Database). This widely-used database included valuable details about TV shows, including ratings, genres, languages, release dates, and more. The dataset featured information on 150,000 TV shows, which was cleaned and preprocessed for further analysis.

Project Goals:
The main objective was to predict the popularity of TV shows based on features like genres, languages, vote counts, and others. While it was known that factors like genre and language influenced a show's popularity, the exact relationship remained unclear. I aimed to explore this through data analysis and machine learning. Success was determined by the modelâ€™s ability to accurately predict popularity, which could help inform content strategy decisions. Key factors affecting results included the number of seasons, vote count, genre, language, networks, and release dates.

1.	Data Preparation: In this stage, the dataset was cleaned and preprocessed by filtering the data to include only the years from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2024. Columns with a high percentage of missing data, such as 'tagline' and 'created_by', were dropped. Similar or redundant columns were also removed to streamline the dataset. The 'overview' column was extracted into a separate DataFrame to facilitate feature engineering. Dummies for the 'languages', 'Networks', and 'Genres' columns were created. Additionally, the text data was cleaned to ensure consistency and accuracy, preparing the dataset for further analysis and model training.
